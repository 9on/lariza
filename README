sn - sonst nix
==============

This is a minimalistic web browser using Gtk3 and WebKit. "Sonst nix" is
german and translates roughly to "nothing else". sn is simple and meant
to stay simple.

Features:

	- A WebKit viewport
	- Global content zoom
	- Pluggability into suckless' tabbed

Planned features:

	- An input box to change the current URL
	- vi-like shortcuts
	- Adblock


Using sn with tabbed
====================

The order of arguments for sn doesn't matter. This means you can run it
like this:

	$ tabbed -c ./sn file:///home/hans/bookmarks.html -z 0.8 -e

Each new tab will then show your bookmarks and is scaled by a factor of
0.8.
