zea - zeig's einfach an
=======================

zea is a minimalistic web browser using Gtk2, GLib and WebKit. "Zeig's
einfach an" is german and translates roughly to "just show it" (the damn
web page).

Features:

	- A WebKit viewport
	- An input box to change the current URL
	- Global content zoom
	- Pluggability into suckless' tabbed
	- vi-like scrolling (modified by CTRL)
	- Searching the current page for a word
	- Adblock
	- Support for Flash and Java
	- Cooperative instances using FIFOs (can be turned off)

Planned features:

	- Keyword based searching (opening "wi foo" will search wikipedia)


Using zea with tabbed
=====================

The order of arguments for zea doesn't matter. This means you can run it
like this:

	$ tabbed -c ./zea file:///home/hans/bookmarks.html -z 0.8 -e

Each new tab will then show your bookmarks and is scaled by a factor of
0.8.

If "-e" is not specified, zea will launch tabbed automatically. Note
that you can't use tabbed's "Ctrl+Shift+Enter" hotkey to open a new tab
this way (zea will simply call "tabbed -c -d", so tabbed will know
nothing about zea). However, due to zea's cooperative instances, you can
simply start zea a second time and it will create a new tab.


Adblock
=======

zea has built-in adblock functionality. In each line of

	~/.config/zea/adblock.black

you can store a regular expression. These expressions match
case-insensitive and partially, i.e. ".*foo.*" is the same as ".*FOO.*"
and you can use anchors like "^https?://...".
