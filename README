zea - zeig's einfach an
=======================

zea is a minimalistic web browser using Gtk2 and WebKit. "Zeig's einfach
an" is german and translates roughly to "just show it" (the damn web
page).

Features:

	- A WebKit viewport
	- An input box to change the current URL
	- Global content zoom
	- Pluggability into suckless' tabbed
	- vi-like scrolling (modified by CTRL)
	- Support for Flash and Java

Planned features:

	- Searching the current page for a word
	- Adblock
	- Keyword based searching (opening "wi foo" will search wikipedia)


Using zea with tabbed
====================

The order of arguments for zea doesn't matter. This means you can run it
like this:

	$ tabbed -c ./zea file:///home/hans/bookmarks.html -z 0.8 -e

Each new tab will then show your bookmarks and is scaled by a factor of
0.8.
