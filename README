sn - sonst nix
==============

german and translates roughly to "nothing else". sn is simple and meant
to stay simple.

	- A WebKit viewport
	- Global content zoom
	- Pluggability into suckless' tabbed
	- Support for Flash and Java

Planned features:

	- An input box to change the current URL
	- vi-like shortcuts

Using sn with tabbed
====================

The order of arguments for sn doesn't matter. This means you can run it
like this:

	$ tabbed -c ./sn file:///home/hans/bookmarks.html -z 0.8 -e

Each new tab will then show your bookmarks and is scaled by a factor of
0.8.
