sn - sonst nix
==============

This is a minimalistic web browser using Gtk3 and WebKit. "Sonst nix" is
german and translates roughly to "nothing else". sn is simple and meant
to stay simple.

Features:

	- A WebKit viewport
	- Global content zoom

Planned features:

	- An input box to change the current URL
	- vi-like shortcuts
	- Adblock
	- Pluggability into suckless' tabbed (preferred) or native tabs


Why WebKit instead of WebKit2?
==============================

While WebKit2 has fancy process separation and all that stuff, it turned
out to be pretty slow and clunky. Plus, ideally, sn will be plugged into
suckless' tabbed -- so it wouldn't benefit from process separation
anyway.
